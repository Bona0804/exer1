                    <p>Hello there, I am Mark Domingo G. Bonayon but you can call me <b>Bona</b>. I am a 2nd year BSCS student. My favorite CS subject is <b>CMSC 22</b> because it gives me the knowledge about object-oriented programming. On the other hand, <b>Ethics 1</b> is my favorite GE course because I love to read and study about philosophical views in life. </p>
                    <p><b>Java</b> is my favorite programming language since it is used in CMSC 22 and I can do a lot of things with it. Lastly, I want to share that my favorite food is <b>burger</b>. </p>
